# Survey form with React

Created a survey with React where each question leads you to a new one. In the end the user inputs are displayed in an overview and you get suggestion on games you should play based on those inputs.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next? I tried to plan my design with figma but the actual result did not look like it at all. But I am happy I tried it out anyway! I tried to make some if else to display different suggestion on the last overview of the survey. Turned out to be a lot of code but could after some help make it more neat. I wish I had time to create validation of the form. Maybe will add that later.
